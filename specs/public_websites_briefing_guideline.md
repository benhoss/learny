# Public Websites Briefing Guideline — Learny Platform

## 1) Purpose of this guideline

This document is the **single briefing template and execution guide** for creating Learny’s public-facing websites. It aligns website strategy, messaging, UX, visual design, content operations, legal/trust requirements, and technical implementation with the product direction in:
- `specs/business_specs.md`
- `specs/technical_specs.md`

Use this guideline when briefing internal teams, agencies, freelancers, or AI-assisted production workflows.

## 2) Business context and strategic intent

### Product context
Learny is an AI-powered learning companion for children (primary target: ages 10–14), with parents as key decision-makers and supervisors.

### Core market problem
Families need trustworthy, effective study support. Existing tools often optimize shortcuts instead of understanding.

### Strategic website objective
The public websites must:
1. Build trust with parents and schools.
2. Explain child learning value clearly and quickly.
3. Convert visitors into high-intent signups/trials.
4. Support retention via help, trust, and education content.

### Positioning statement (website-ready)
“Learny helps children learn from their own school material through short, engaging AI-powered sessions—designed for understanding, not cheating.”

## 5) Messaging architecture

### Core message pillars

4. **Parent trust, controls, and transparency**
5. **AI for understanding, not shortcutting**

### Proof elements required on page
- Product screenshots / walkthrough snippets

- Social proof (testimonials, pilot signals, expert quotes when available)

### Tone of voice

- Evidence-led, never hype-heavy
- Avoid jargon unless immediately explained

## 8) Design system briefing (visual + UX guidelines)

## Brand personality in UI
- Friendly, optimistic, modern
- Educational + playful balance
- Safety and trust visibly embedded

## Color strategy
Use a soft, energetic palette that balances play and trust:
- **Primary accent:** warm coral/salmon for momentum and CTA emphasis
- **Secondary accent:** teal for clarity and learning signal
- **Support accent:** purple/lilac for creativity and progression
- **Neutrals:** warm off-whites and muted grays for readability

Guidelines:
- Reserve highest-contrast treatments for primary CTA only.
- Avoid over-saturation in large text areas.
- Maintain WCAG AA contrast minimums.

## Typography
- Headings: geometric/rounded sans feel (friendly confidence)
- Body: highly readable sans-serif
- Minimum base size: 16px on desktop and mobile
- Line length target: 60–75 characters for long-form reading

## Spacing and layout
- Use 8px spacing scale
- Section rhythm: generous vertical spacing to reduce cognitive load
- Keep major sections scannable with clear visual anchors

## Components to standardize
- Navbar (sticky, compact on scroll)
- Buttons (primary/secondary/ghost)
- Cards (feature, trust, FAQ)
- Comparison tables (pricing/features)
- Testimonials
- Inline trust badges/callouts
- Footer (policy/help/navigation)

## Visual asset guidelines
- Prioritize authentic product UI captures over generic stock visuals
- Illustration style: simple, rounded, educational
- Character/mascot visuals may support delight, never distract from CTA
- Use motion subtly (fade/float/stagger); always respect reduced-motion preferences

## Interaction design
- Fast perceived performance (skeletons, progressive loading where needed)
- Clear hover/focus states
- Keyboard navigability across interactive components
- Avoid autoplay audio/video

---

## 9) Content design and copywriting guidelines

## Content principles
- One idea per section
- Plain language first
- Outcome-focused, not feature-dense
- Parent concerns answered proactively

## Copy pattern by section
- Hero: 1 promise + 1 proof + 1 action
- Feature blocks: “What it is / Why it matters / What changes for family”
- Trust blocks: “What we do / Why it’s safe / What control parents have”
- FAQ: concise answers with links to deeper documentation

## Readability targets
- Aim for grade 6–8 readability on core marketing pages
- Keep paragraphs short (2–4 lines on desktop width)
- Use bullets for process explanations

## Required legal/content review checkpoints
- Privacy and safety claims must be validated by legal/compliance before publish
- Do not imply guaranteed academic outcomes
- Avoid absolute claims (“100% safe”, “always improves grades”)

---

## 10) Trust, safety, and ethics requirements

Given child audiences and AI use, trust is not a footer task; it is a core UX layer.

Must include:
1. Parent supervision model summary on key conversion pages.
2. Clear “AI for understanding” stance in hero or early-page narrative.
3. Data handling explanations in plain language with deep links to legal docs.
4. Reporting/help pathways for safety concerns.
5. Age-appropriate messaging boundaries (no manipulative dark patterns).

---

## 11) Localization and internationalization

- Prepare CMS/content structure for multilingual expansion from day one.
- Avoid embedding text in images.
- Define locale rules for:
  - pricing display
  - date/time formats

### Content SEO baseline
